\f0\fs24 \cf0 1) For processing this data, I used pandas package for reading and maneuvering the data, as well as plotting. Pandas has a very useful function called groupby which allowed me to easily count the number of rows for each department. I did my initial plotting in ipython, then modified the code to run from command line. I could\'92ve used matplotlib for this exercise, and I actually did try it as an alternative, but it required much more code for this simple procedure.\
2) I am surprised to find out that most of the 311 calls are made to the HPD, by a very wide margin. The FDNY ranks 13, which I think is pretty low; I would\'92ve expected FDNY to rank much higher. TLC even came in higher than FDNY. I expected perhaps NYPD to be ranked first or at least 2nd, but it is ranked third. DOT I  would\'92ve expected in the top 3, and it satisfies this, ranking 2nd. I am surprised DEP ranked ahead of DSNY. }
