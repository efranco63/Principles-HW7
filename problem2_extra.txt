\f0\fs24 \cf0 1) The script is run exactly as it is run for problem 2.2, where the arguments given are the name of the 311 complaint csv file and the second argument is the number of agencies one wishes to study. The file names are problem2_2_extra_hour.py and problem2_2_extra_min.py, representing statistics on call volumes by hour and by minute.\
2) If we look at the top 10 agencies and their call volume by hour of day, we notice a few interesting patterns. First, let\'92s look at DOT complaints. These have 2 large peaks at around 10am and 2pm, with a large dip in-between them at noon. This could possibly correspond to some rush hour traffic. Outside of the 8am - 5pm time window, complaints are relatively low for the DOT. For the NYPD, at around 1am complaints begin to drop off, hitting their daily lows at around 4am and then around 5am volume begins to pick up and remains steady from 8am to 5pm, and after this time window the volume begins to climb fast, reaching its peak around 11pm. The DSNY experiences most volume in the morning from 7-9am and afterwards slowly drops off (these are probably complaints on garbage collection). The rest of the departments experience most of their activity during the 8am-5pm time window. If we now look at the top 10 agencies and their call volume by minute, a few spikes in call volumes at certain minutes pop out. For DSNY there are 3 very noticeable and high peaks relative to the rest of its volumes occurring approximately at the 30, 40, and 50 minute marks. The DEP also has a very noticeable and singular spike happening at approximately the 15 minute mark and the DOT experiences a very noticeable and singular spike at the 30 minute mark. Why these spikes at these particular minute marks of the hour? The minute marks are very specific to 15,30,40 and 50, and don\'92t appear random. If these spikes were random one might expect some of the minutes to not round to be multiples of 5s. This might indicate that there is some systematic reason that call volumes peak at these minutes of the hour. The spikes are also significant enough to warrant this.  }
