\f0\fs24 \cf0 There is a very peculiar pattern for a significant number of zip codes where the call volume is very low and the agency with the most calls in that zip code, in most cases the only agency with calls, is the TLC. I\'92ve plotted on a map the locations of all these incidents (see attached image titled TLC_Zips) and the majority of them, with the exception of one zip code in Manhattan, appear to fall outside of the proper city limits of New York City. To investigate further it might be helpful to look into the complaint type, but given that these are all outside of NYC city limits and that they are to the TLC, perhaps not too much can be revealed via this information. My speculation is that these might be complaints related to some kind of traffic altercation with taxis or black cars.  }
